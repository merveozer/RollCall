I have created a desktop application with using MS-SQL, C#, Windows Forms on VS2019. My project is used on smart-boards at my school. This application helps us with roll call, its task is to create an Excel file, write roll-call data on this file. And task complete when the app sends this file by e-mail to the school manager. Thanks to it we donâ€™t need paper and we can collect simply roll-call data with digital alternatives.
