I have created a desktop application with using MS-SQL, C#, Windows Forms on VS2019. My project is used on smart-boards at my school. This application helps us with roll call, its task is to create an Excel file, write roll-call data on this file. And task complete when the app sends this file by e-mail to the school manager. Thanks to it we donâ€™t need paper and we can collect simply roll-call data with digital alternatives.

If the teacher forgets to select the lesson, a warning message seems.

The send button is disenabled during break time. In this way, roll-call data cannot be changed by students.

When the selected lesson is "6.DERS" (THIS IS the LAST LESSON), the app sends an e-mail to the school manager.

The last column contains the total number of courses the student attends.
